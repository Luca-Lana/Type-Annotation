# Type Annotations Python ðŸ–‹

## Description 

In this project I will practice my python studies on typing functions, variables, parameters and everything else. 

And it will help these two libraries to check my code if there is something wrong.

## Libraries ðŸ“š

- [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/)

- [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)

## Installation ðŸ’»

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the libraries.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use the Project

For this libraries work and you do not need to use the command line, you have to put this setting in your "settings.json" on vscode.

```json

{
    "python.linting.flake8Enabled": true,
    "python.linting.mypyEnabled": true
}

```
